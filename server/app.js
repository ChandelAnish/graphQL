// Our httpServer handles incoming requests to our Express app.
// Below, we tell Apollo Server to "drain" this httpServer,
// enabling our servers to shut down gracefully.

const httpServer = http.createServer(app);//An HTTP server is created to handle incoming requests to the Express app. This server is necessary because ApolloServer doesn't directly handle HTTP requestsâ€”it relies on an HTTP server like this one.

// Same ApolloServer initialization as before, plus the drain plugin
// for our httpServer.
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs:mergedTypeDefs,
  resolvers:mergedResolvers,
  plugins: [ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer({ httpServer })],//This plugins is used to ensure that the server shuts down gracefully when it is stopped or restarted.The ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer is like a polite way of shutting down your server.
    // This plugin gives the server time to finish ongoing work before shutting down.
    // It stops taking new requests but lets the current ones finish so no data is lost or interrupted.
    // The reason httpServer is passed into ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer({ httpServer }) is to give Apollo Server access to the underlying HTTP server (created by Express) so that it can manage the shutdown process gracefully
    //ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer needs to interact with this httpServer because the GraphQL API you're running through Apollo Server is served via this HTTP server.
    //You pass httpServer to the plugin so that Apollo can manage the entire lifecycle of the HTTP server, ensuring that when your app shuts down, it does so smoothly without cutting off active connections or requests.

// Ensure we wait for our server to start
await server.start();//This ensures the Apollo server is started and ready to handle requests before Express starts.

// write this in package.json (**recommended) --> "build": "npm install && cd client && npm install && npm run build"

// Breakdown of the Command :

// npm install: Installs all dependencies listed in the root project's package.json, creating a node_modules folder if it doesn't exist.

// &&: Ensures that the second command only runs if the first command completes successfully.

// npm install --prefix client: The --prefix flag specifies the directory where npm should look for the package.json    file and install dependencies. In this case, it points to the client directory.
// This command will install the dependencies listed in the package.json file located in the client directory, creating or updating the node_modules folder inside the client folder.

// npm run build --prefix client : similarly for this command also
